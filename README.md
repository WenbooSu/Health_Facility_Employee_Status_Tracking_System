Health Facility Employee Status Tracking System
The project is titled "Health Facility Employee Status
Tracking System HFESTS", which develops a database system to help health care facilities to keep track of their employeesâ€™
health status during the COVID-19 pandemic. It records all necessary information and will notify the employees if they have contacted other employees who have been infected so they can pay attention to it. The database is designed based on the E/R model.
